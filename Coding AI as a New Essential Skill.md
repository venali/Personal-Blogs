In today's world, reading and writing are fundamental skills that many people possess. In the future, I envision coding, particularly for artificial intelligence (AI), becoming just as widespread. Historically, language literacy was not deemed essential; only a select few could read and write, while the rest relied on them. It took centuries for literacy to become widespread, greatly enriching society.

Language allows for deep communication between humans, while code facilitates profound human-to-machine interaction. As machines play an increasingly central role in our daily lives, the importance of this interaction grows.

Traditional software engineering, which involves instructing computers through explicit sequences of steps, has been the main route to coding literacy. Introductory programming courses often use projects like video game creation or website building as teaching tools. However, AI, machine learning, and data science offer a new approach where computers derive knowledge from data, presenting an even better pathway to learning coding skills.

For example, the owner of my neighborhood izakaya, where I often buy gyoza, might not have a compelling reason to learn how to develop a video game or build a website. However, AI and data science could significantly benefit his business. A linear regression model could help him predict customer demand more accurately, optimizing staffing and supply chain management. He could forecast sales of specific items, like garlic gyoza (my favorite!), allowing him to prepare in advance and reduce customer wait times.

AI and data science applications are relevant in any data-producing context, making them valuable across numerous professions. This relevance enhances the importance of AI-oriented coding literacy, potentially allowing individuals to leverage data to improve their lives significantly.

I believe the potential to create basic AI applications, more so than traditional software, will inspire more people to learn to code. If society adopts this new form of literacy as it has reading and writing, we will all reap the benefits.
