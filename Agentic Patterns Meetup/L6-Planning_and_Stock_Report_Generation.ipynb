      "Here's the Python code that you'll need to run to retrieve this data for Nvidia from March 23, 2024, to April 23, 2024. If you haven't installed the `yfinance` package yet, you'll also need to install it using pip.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# filename: fetch_nvidia_data.py\n",
      "import yfinance as yf\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "# Ensure you have 'yfinance' installed: pip install yfinance\n",
      "\n",
      "def fetch_stock_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):\n",
      "    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)\n",
      "    data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instructions:\n",
      "1. Save the above script into a file named `fetch_nvidia_data.py`.\n",
      "2. Run the script. If `yfinance` is not installed, you can install it by running `pip install yfinance`.\n",
      "3. Once you have run the script, it will print the historical stock data for Nvidia, including Open, High, Low, Close prices and Volume for the dates specified. \n",

      "### Alternative Steps:\n",
      "1. **Check Date Range**: Verify that the date range (March 23, 2024 to April 23, 2024) does not include future dates or dates for which the data might not yet be available. Considering today is April 27, 2024, it suggests a possible mistake in the system date handling or an issue with real-time data fetching.\n",

      "2. **Data Availability**: Verify if there are restrictions or issues with `yfinance` for fetching data, sometimes caused by changes on the Yahoo Finance side or network issues.\n",

      "3. **Retry or Use Alternative Data Source**: We might need to retry the request or consider using an alternative source for the stock data. \n",

      "2. **Major news or events affecting Nvidia stock**: Any corporate announcements, market news, or economic events impacting the stock during this period.\n",

      "### First Step:\n",
      "Let's start by retrieving the historical stock prices of Nvidia for the past month. This can be done using Python libraries such as `pandas_datareader` or `yfinance`. After fetching the data, the next steps will be structured accordingly based on the retrieved data.\n",

      "To proceed with collecting the stock price data for Nvidia, we'll use the `yfinance` library in Python. This library allows us to fetch historical market data from Yahoo Finance seamlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the Python code that you'll need to run to retrieve this data for Nvidia from March 23, 2024, to April 23, 2024. If you haven't installed the `yfinance` package yet, you'll also need to install it using pip.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# filename: fetch_nvidia_data.py\n",
      "import yfinance as yf\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "\n",
      "# Ensure you have 'yfinance' installed: pip install yfinance\n",
      "\n",

      "    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)\n",
      "    data = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)\n",

      "\n",
      "### Instructions:\n",
      "1. Save the above script into a file named `fetch_nvidia_data.py`.\n",
      "2. Run the script. If `yfinance` is not installed, you can install it by running `pip install yfinance`.\n",
      "3. Once you have run the script, it will print the historical stock data for Nvidia, including Open, High, Low, Close prices and Volume for the dates specified. \n",

      "1. **Check Date Range**: Verify that the date range (March 23, 2024 to April 23, 2024) does not include future dates or dates for which the data might not yet be available. Considering today is April 27, 2024, it suggests a possible mistake in the system date handling or an issue with real-time data fetching.\n",

      "2. **Data Availability**: Verify if there are restrictions or issues with `yfinance` for fetching data, sometimes caused by changes on the Yahoo Finance side or network issues.\n",
